# "Let's Build A Gutenberg Block" at WordCamp EU, 2018!

This Github project will provide the reference files and roadmap for our workshop today. Each portion will be introduced with a short lecture followed by an exercise. The schedule is as follows:

### Prerequisites:

Please have the following prepared for the workshop:

* Local install of WordPress
* Up to date install of the Gutenberg plugin
* Node version 8+, npm version 5.3+
* A text editor such as Sublime, VSCode, or Atom

### Part 0: Introductions

1. Find a pair programming partner 
2. In your pair, introduce yourself:
  * Name
  * Your experience with WordPress
  * A frustrating moment in development

### Part 1: What _is_ Gutenberg?

1. Create a few blocks in Gutenberg. Add some options to the paragraph block using the block inspector. 
2. View the block from the frontend and see where the styles are coming from using the Inspector.
3. Deactivate the Gutenberg plugin.
4. Reload the WYSIWYG editor and note the comments surrounding blocks. 
5. Reload the frontend and note any styling differences.
6. Reactivate Gutenberg and see blocks re-appear.

### Part 2: Scaffold a block with `create-guten-block`

1. Open the terminal (On Mac: Applications > Utilities > Terminal).
2. Type `node -v` and hit Enter. 
  * If you get a response of `v8.0.0` or greater, proceed to step 3. Otherwise, skip to step 3.1
2. Type `npm -v` and hit Enter. 
  * If you get a response of `v5.3.0` or greater, proceed to step 3. Otherwise, skip to step 3.1.
3. `cd` into the plugins directory of your local install. Run the command `npx create-guten-block wceu-2018` and watch the magic unfold!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Guten Block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block).

Below you will find some information on how to run scripts.

>You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block).

## ðŸ‘‰  `npm start`
- Use to compile and run the block in development mode.
- Watches for any changes and reports back any errors in your code.

## ðŸ‘‰  `npm run build`
- Use to build production code for your block inside `dist` folder.
- Runs once and reports back the gzip file sizes of the produced code.

## ðŸ‘‰  `npm run eject`
- Use to eject your plugin out of `create-guten-block`.
- Provides all the configurations so you can customize the project as you want.
- It's a one-way street, `eject` and you have to maintain everything yourself.
- You don't normally have to `eject` a project because by ejecting you lose the connection with `create-guten-block` and from there onwards you have to update and maintain all the dependencies on your own.
